Vehicle Motion control Mechanism using FPGA

DESCRIPTION:
The primary objective of this project was to get familiarized with the FPGA. So we had opted for a project oriented learning so that it could enhance our skills. The abstract is about controlling the speed of the car near a traffic signal by taking input (signal status and time remaining for the signal to change) form a transciever at a traffic signal and controlling the motion accordingly. The logic behind this is simple, as we have to calculate the distance that can be travelled by the car in the remaining time using the speed of the car and comparing it with a distance from the traffic signal.
